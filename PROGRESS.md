## Progress Log

Date: 2025-09-25

### Added
- Command streaming client integration (`useCommandStream` composable) with WebSocket handling, output parsing, and state management.
- Output display component `CommandOutput.vue` (scrollback, follow tail, clear, status, exit code badge).
- Normalized WebSocket server handler to emit consistent raw line objects (removed wrapped shape).
- Integrated output component into `index.vue` page beneath command buttons.
- Created this progress log per project guidelines.

### Notes / Next Ideas
- Consider adding cancel endpoint (graceful termination) and UI Stop button.
- Add authentication/authorization check inside WS handler if session not implicitly enforced.
- Persist a short command history (last N exit codes) in store for UX.
- Add download/export of output for long-running commands.

### Enhancements (Second Pass)
- Implemented cancel command endpoint & front-end cancel button.
- Added execution history (last 25) with exit codes + timestamps.
- WebSocket now enforces auth via `requireAuth`.
- Store exposes `markExited` to archive results.
- UI renders recent history list.

### Enhancements (Third Pass - Reliability & Force Kill)
- Force kill (SIGKILL) support via `DELETE /api/commands/:id?force=1` and `forceKillCommand`.
- Graceful cancel schedules auto force kill after 7s (see `COMMAND_CANCEL_FORCE_TIMEOUT`).
- Retry & reconnect (up to 3 attempts, exponential backoff) for transient WebSocket disconnects.
- Synthetic meta lines emitted client-side for reconnect attempts/errors for transparency.
- UI additions: force kill button, reconnect status indicator.
